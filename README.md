                        Madara Uchiha ( Uchiha Madara) was the legendary leader of the Uchiha clan. He founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama Senju, with the intention of beginning an era of peace. When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve that peace, they fought for control of the village, a conflict which ended in Madara's death. Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into hiding to work on his own plans. Unable to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to Obito shortly before his actual death. Years later, Madara would be revived, only to see his plans foiled and ultimately, and finally, realising the error of his ways and making amends with Hashirama before his final death.

                        Obito Uchiha (, Uchiha Obito) was a member of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan. He was believed to have died during the Third Shinobi World War, his only surviving legacy being the Sharingan he gave to his teammate, Kakashi Hatake. In truth, Obito was saved from death and trained by Madara, but the events of the war left Obito disillusioned with reality, and he inherited Madara's plan to create an ideal world. Resurfacing under the names of Tobi ( Tobi) and Madara Uchiha himself, Obito subtly took control of the Akatsuki, using them as a means to advance his machinations, eventually going public and starting the Fourth Shinobi World War. However, towards the war's conclusion, Obito had a change of heart and, as atonement, sacrificed his life to save the same world he sought to replace.

                        Itachi Uchiha (, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain. He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja â€” including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.

                        Sasuke Uchiha (Uchiha Sasuke) is one of the last surviving members of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan. After his older brother, Itachi, slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission in life to avenge them by killing Itachi. He is added to Team 7 upon becoming a ninja and, through competition with his rival and best friend, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke starts developing his skills. Dissatisfied with his progress, he defects from Konoha so that he can acquire the strength needed to exact his revenge. His years of seeking vengeance and his actions that followed become increasingly demanding, irrational and isolates him from others, leading him to be branded as an international criminal. After learning the truth of his brother's sacrifice, later proving instrumental in ending the Fourth Shinobi World War, and being happily redeemed by Naruto, Sasuke decides to return to Konoha and dedicate his life to help protect the village and its inhabitants, becoming referred to as the "Supporting Kage" (, Sasaukage, literally meaning: Supporting Shadow).

                        Shisui was a very humble and down-to-earth individual. He was never arrogant about his own talent
                        or accomplishments, yet was not above telling others when they made mistakes. At the same time,
                        he was open-minded, never stubbornly believing in one ideal solely and strove to see that unique
                        nature of current situation before him. Shisui was also a deeply compassionate man, even to
                        enemies, showing sympathy and kindness to a dying Mukai Kohinata despite having been ordered to
                        assassinate him as a traitor. He was also shown to be very perceptive and intuitive even from
                        a young age, able to see through the emotional nature of others and likewise able to notice the
                        smallest details around him.Shisui came to care for Itachi very much; in fact, he was like a big
                        brother to Itachi. Shisui taught Itachi that "self-sacrificeâ€¦ a nameless shinobi who protects
                        peace from within its shadowâ€¦" was the true mark of a shinobi. Shisui was also very devoted to
                        the clan, which is why the Konoha Military Police Force asked him to spy on Itachi.
                        It is because of this devotion that the police did not believe he could have committed 
                       suicide. This devotion was so great, his best friend Itachi believed that had he been alive
                        during the Uchiha's downfall, he would have protected the clan to the very end,even from him.
